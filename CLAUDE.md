## Agent Communication

- **Concise Reporting and Exception Highlighting**
  When reporting, do not restate well-known or obvious steps.  
  Always highlight any deviations from the original instructions, unexpected issues, or trade-offs,
  and make these stand out clearly.  
  If nothing unusual occurred, provide only a brief confirmation, optionally including a few bullet points summarizing the changes made or key points to review.
- **Contradiction Check**  
  If any contradictions, ambiguities, or mutually exclusive requirements are detected in the user's instructions,
  pause execution and ask the user for clarification before proceeding.

## Command Execution

- **Directory Safety**  
  Do not change the current working directory (avoid `cd` commands),
  and use relative paths for all file operations.  
- **Safe and Reusable Code Validation**  
  Avoid creating and executing ad-hoc scripts for behavior checks;
  instead, implement a small, reusable function and write unit tests for it
  to improve safety, reviewability, and long-term value.
