# Architecture Overview

## Core Concept

This project is a **pluggable static analysis framework** built around the concept of sharing expensive operations.
Multiple custom analysis rules (inspectors) share a single AST traversal per file,
making it efficient to run many specialized checks without NÃ— performance costs.

## Module Responsibility Boundaries

- **`index.ts` (API) and `bin.ts` (CLI)**: Main entry points
- **`error/`**: Error handling types and classes - foundational layer for all modules
- **`main/`**: Re-exported through main entry point - high-level functionality
  - **`main/orchestrator/`**: High-level coordination - execution flow, options processing, and configuration management
  - **`main/builtin-inspectors/`**: Built-in inspector implementations (e.g., no-type-assertions)
  - **`main/builtin-reporters/`**: Built-in reporter implementations (summary, raw-json)
- **`inspector/`**: Core inspection framework - abstraction of pluggable inspectors and execution engine
- **`diagnostics/`**: Diagnostic types and severity handling utilities
  - **`diagnostics/markup/`**: Markup-specific diagnostic utilities and builders
- **`reporter/`**: Output formatting and presentation layer
  - **`reporter/printer/`**: Low-level printing utilities for structured output
- **`source-file/`**: TypeScript Compiler API abstraction layer for source file parsing
- **`internal/utils/`**: Shared utilities and types (should not depend on any other modules in this project)

## Public API Entry Points

The library exports functionality through multiple entry points for modularity:

- **`.`**: Main inspection functions (`inspectProject`, `inspectFiles`, etc.)
- **`./error`**: Error types and classes (`TsInspectError`, `TsInspectErrorType`, `errorTypeToMessage`)
- **`./diagnostics`**: Type definitions and utilities for diagnostic data structures
- **`./diagnostics/markup`**: Markup-specific diagnostic utilities
- **`./inspector`**: Inspector framework types and utilities for creating custom inspectors
- **`./reporter`**: Reporter interface and built-in reporter implementations

This modular approach allows consumers to import only the specific functionality they need.

## Execution Flow

1. **Configuration Resolution**: Process tsconfig.json/jsconfig.json if project-based inspection
2. **Concurrent Parsing**: Source files parsed to TypeScript AST in parallel (non-blocking)
3. **Per-File Inspection**: Single AST traversal executes all inspectors per file, each inspector accumulating its own state
4. **Per-Inspector Aggregation**: Each inspector's `ResultsBuilder` independently processes accumulated state of all files into structured diagnostic data
5. **Reporting**: Reporter functions format the diagnostic results for output
6. **Exit Code Determination**: Final exit code determined by worst severity among all findings

## Diagnostic System

The framework uses a structured diagnostic system. There are two diagnostic patterns:

### SimpleDiagnostics

The most common pattern, used when an inspector has a single message that applies to all findings.
Findings are organized by file, where each file contains an array of location-specific findings.

### RichDiagnostics

Used for complex analysis where each finding needs its own specific message.
This pattern supports three scopes of findings:

- **Project-level**: Issues that affect the entire codebase (architecture, dependencies, etc.)
- **File-level**: Issues that apply to an entire file (missing exports, file structure, etc.)  
- **Location-specific**: Issues tied to specific code locations (like most linting rules)
